# Weather_python
This is a weather application. Python's python weather package was used to create this.
This is more convenient than utilising a weather API. I'm not saying it's terrible; it's just that using the python weather package is more convenient.

Here are all the links for python weather github, the python pip install page for python weather, and a video of mine showing how to use it.
